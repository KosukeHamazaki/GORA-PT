# GORA-PT
## Gradient-based Optimization of Resource Allocation of progeny in breeding schemes with PyTorch
This directory is a public directory to share the scripts, simulated datasets, and results for the paper "Differentiable breeding: Automatic differentiation enables efficient gradient-based optimization of breeding strategies". 
In the "BSP" folder, we shared the core codes for the differentiable breeding schemes implemented by the automatic differentiation function of PyTorch.
In the "scripts" folder, we shared the codes to perform gradient-based and black-box-based optimizations.
In the "midstream.zip", we shared the initial datasets simulated by R.
